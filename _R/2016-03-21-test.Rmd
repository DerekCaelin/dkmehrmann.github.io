This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

I'll be testing [David Robinson's](http://varianceexplained.org/about/) [script](https://github.com/dgrtwo/dgrtwo.github.com/blob/master/_scripts/knitpages.R) with my implementation of a Jekyll Blog. Specifically, I'm using Github Pages to host my site and I'd like to try embedding RMardown documents. In the future, I'd like to implement something similar for IPython Notebook files.

## R Code and Output

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

## R Plot

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

That's the end of the test. If this works I'll try something more intense!

## Notes on Trial Run

* The header won't be exactly right: you'll have to add layout at the very least
* The naming convention of the .Rmd file has to follow the convention of the .md files
