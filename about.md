title: About

My name is Andrew Mehrmann and I'm currently a Master's Student in Statistics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I also completed a BA in Economics at UIUC in 2015. I'm interested in pursuing a career in Data Science/Statistics when I graduate in December 2016.

I'm also a student researcher in <a href="http://www.astro.illinois.edu/people/bigdog">Professor Robert Brunner's</a> Research Group where I specialize in text analysis. Specifically, I work with the <a href='http://www.clinecenter.illinois.edu/'>Cline Center for Democracy</a> to assess some of their research practices as they relate to text analysis. In addition to my own research I mentor some undergraduate students to get them started with basic text mining.

Recently, I've been tasked with creating a <a href="http://ui-datascience.github.io/">webpage</a> for our research group and have found the experience equal parts challenging and rewarding. Web Design (at a very basic level) is a new domain for me and I've found that I'm not immediately very good at it, so I've been doing quite a bit of it lately to get better. This was the motivation behind creating this site, along with the observation that many of the people I respect and like in this field have their own sites/blogs. A few that I really enjoy are:

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/">FiveThirtyEight</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.randalolson.com/blog/">Randy Olson's Blog</a></li>
	<li><a href='http://varianceexplained.org/posts/'>Variance Explained</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://machinelearningmastery.com/blog/">Machine Learning Mastery</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://simplystatistics.org/">Simply Statistics</a></li>
	<li><a href='http://blog.yhat.com/'>Yhat</a></li>
</ul>

And this really isn't a blog but it is an absolutely beautiful way to demonstrate how decision trees work:

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/">A Visual Introduction to Machine Learning</a></li>
</ul>

Finally, a couple of my favorite papers:

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~pedrod/papers/cacm12.pdf">Domingos 2012, A Few Useful Things to Know about Machine Learning</a></li>
	<li><a href='http://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.ss/1009213726'>Breiman 2001, Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures</a></li>
</ul>

This site is published with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. I've been really impressed with the Jekyll framework although it was a little daunting to learn with absolutely zero HTML or CSS experience. If you'd like to see some tips and tricks I learned while creating this site, check out my <a href='/jekyll/2016/03/19/welcome-to-jekyll.html'>Hello World!</a> post.
